## Important Notes

- Your app uses localStorage, so each user's data stays on their device
- The authentication is client-side only (suitable for personal use)
- All files are static HTML/CSS/JS, so any static host will work
- Make sure `index.html` is your main entry point

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deploying, you can add a custom domain:

- GitHub Pages: Add CNAME file with your domain
- Netlify: Go to Domain settings
- Vercel: Go to Domain settings

## File Structure Check

Make sure you have these files in your root directory:

- âœ… index.html (entry point)
- âœ… auth.html
- âœ… main.html
- âœ… auth.js
- âœ… script.js
- âœ… auth.css
- âœ… styles.css
- âœ… README.md

Your project is ready to deploy! ðŸš€
